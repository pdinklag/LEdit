                <b>LEdit</b> is a ROM editor for the SNES game "Lufia II - Rise of the Sinistrals".
                It is, more accurately, a collection of editors for various types of contents of the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both the English (E) and the German (G) ROM files (SMC) are currently supported.
            </p>

            <p>
                The creation of LEdit required a good amount of SNES ASM hacking and reverse engineering.
                The following people have contributed to this project:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Bernard "Reli" Algain</b><br>
                    Created the <i>Reliquary</i>, a vast compendium about Lufia II ROM knowledge. Without
                    these documents, some obstacles in the ROM research process would have taken a lot
                    more time to overcome.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Universal</b><br>
                    Contributed a few very useful internal format tables that accelerated the progress, especially
                    related to item editing.
                </li>
                <li><b>Patrick "pdinklag" Dinklage</b><br>
                    Yours truly, found an extraction algorithm for the compressed Lufia II resource files and
                    created a hack that allows the game to read uncompressed files, researched the map format among
                    a lot of other things and ultimately created LEdit.
